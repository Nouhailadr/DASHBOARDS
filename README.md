# DASHBOARDS
I've built some dashboards on Power BI Desktop

# SUBSTANCE ABUSE ANALYSIS
- Dynamic dashboard in Power BI, describing insights about patients, their gender, their ethnicity, admission date, substance abused, age, medical condition and more..
- I used two filters, one controling the gender and the other one controling the admission date, so that all the visuals (Number of patients, average age, everything..) change when the filter changes. That way, i don't have to add another page.
- Dataset from The entreprise DNA Challenge 23
